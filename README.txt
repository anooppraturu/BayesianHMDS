Python implementation of Bayesian Hyperbolic Multidimensional Scaling Algorithm from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.12.511940v1
Includes functions for generating random samples from hyperbolic space and post-processing
of embedding simulation data.
tst.py generates a distance matrix from a random sample of points in hypeprbolic space and
reconstructs their embedding.
NOTE: this requires pystan 2.0 which is NOT the most current version of pystan.
